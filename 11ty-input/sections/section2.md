My 2022 Apple Report Card
Friday, 10 February 2023
This week Jason Snell published his annual Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2022. As I’ve done for a few years now — 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 — I’m publishing my full remarks and grades here. On Snell’s report card, voters give per-category scores ranging from 5 to 1; I’ve translated these to letter grades, A to E.

THE MAC: A
How would you rate Apple’s performance in the Mac in 2022? Consider new Mac models, the continued Apple Silicon transition, new macOS versions, and anything else you deem relevant. 5 is best, 1 is worst.

MacOS 13 Ventura is a solid upgrade.

The Apple silicon transition continued with another strong year. The MacBook Air is Apple’s most popular and most important Mac, and the M2 models that debuted at WWDC are the best laptops for most people ever made. Thin, light, fast, long-lasting battery life, and they even introduced the midnight colorway — the first truly “dark” laptops from Apple since the black MacBooks sold circa 2006–2008, and before that, the G3 PowerBooks from 2001. Apple silicon is absolutely pantsing its x86 competition, and no one else is making ARM chips for serious PCs.

The Mac Pro was the one Mac that skipped the M1 generation of chips, but while disappointing, that omission was more than made up for by the addition of the Mac Studio — a “small tower for pros” form factor that Mac users have been clamoring for ever since the discontinuation of the G4 Cube.
